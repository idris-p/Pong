# Pong Game

This is a classic Pong game built using Unity, marking my first project with the engine as I begin my journey to become proficient in Unity and game development. The game features two paddles and a ball that bounces between them, with the goal of scoring by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Players control paddles and try to score by hitting the ball into the opponent's goal.
- **Score tracking**: The score is displayed and updates every time a player scores a goal.
- **Responsive controls**: Players can move their paddles up and down to intercept the ball.
- **Game Reset**: The game resets when a player reaches 11 points, showing a UI menu.
- **Pause functionality**: The game can be paused and resumed during play.
